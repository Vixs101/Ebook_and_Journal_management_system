## Ebook and Journal Management system
This is a web-based e-library management system designed to efficiently manage e-books and journals in educational institutions, using Taraba State University as a case study. It enables students to access educational materials remotely, making it easier for them to obtain these resources. The librarian can also add, edit, and remove e-books from the system.
